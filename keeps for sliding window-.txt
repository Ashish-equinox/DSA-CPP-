keeps for sliding window:-

1) use doubly-ended queue to store index of negative element in a particular window
2) deque's first element i.e deque.front() will be the one to give us index of negative element always and then it will be popped as we move to next window 
3) logic to maintain window size:-
    i-deque.front()> k

//1) always while comparision pop or push from back pop/push.back()
 
//2) after comparison use push/pop.front() only
    
//3) also in sliding window condition [i-maxIndex.front()>=k] pop_front should be used 
to pop index of first window...
